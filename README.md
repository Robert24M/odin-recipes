# Odin-recipes
## Description
This is an simple web page with food recipes. I build this as a part of my learning process of web development, based on Odin Project curriculum.
With this project I want to demonstrate basic understanding of HTML and GIT. It is the final project from the Odin Project - HTML Foundation.
